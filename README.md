# Deep Q-Learning and Deep Convolutional Q-Learning Algorithms Implemented on a Minigame

Reinforcement learning project with Deep-Q Learning and Deep Conolutional Q Learning  algorithms.

An AI player is trained with reinforcement learning algorithms to play a minigame. The game requires player to move a square block to evade enemy blocks traveling horizontally throughout the screen. The player can execute four types of actions: moving upwards, downwards, leftwards or rightwards. The AI player plays the game repeatedly and tries to learn the optimal policy by recieving rewards by hitting the enemy, hitting a bonus block or making an idle move.

Both DQL and DConvQL algorithms are implemented within project. The former has the state vector consisting of distances to the enemy blocks and the latter consisting of the rgba values of the all screen pixels.

Implemented as a team project within Kodluyoruz Data Science 102 Bootcamp.
